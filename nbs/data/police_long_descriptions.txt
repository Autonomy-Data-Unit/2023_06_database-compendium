The Police API Documentation for Street-Level Crimes provides access to information about crimes that occur at the street level. Users can retrieve data either within a 1-mile radius of a specific point or within a custom-defined area. It's important to note that the locations provided in the API are only approximations and not the exact crime locations. To ensure privacy and location anonymization, the API employs specific techniques, which can be further explored on the about page. If users are searching for crime data in Scotland, it should be emphasized that crime levels may appear lower than they actually are due to the fact that only the British Transport Police provides data for Scotland. The API supports various request parameters based on specific points or custom areas. When using specific points, users can provide latitude and longitude coordinates, along with an optional date parameter to limit results to a specific month. For custom areas, the "poly" parameter defines the boundary using lat/lng pairs separated by colons. However, if a custom area contains more than 10,000 crimes, the API will return a 503 status code. The API response provides detailed information about each crime, including its category, location details, context, outcome status, and more. The location information includes latitude and longitude coordinates, approximate street name, unique street identifier, and the type of location (Force or British Transport Police). Additionally, the API allows users to query crimes based on specific crime categories. The response description outlines the available crime categories and their corresponding codes. It also explains the outcome status codes, which indicate the latest recorded outcome for a particular crime. Users can make example requests by constructing URLs with the desired parameters, such as the crime category, latitude, longitude, and date. The API will respond with a list of crimes matching the criteria. Please note that the information provided is based on the latest available data and may vary over time.
The Police API Documentation for Crimes with No Location provides access to a list of crimes that could not be mapped to a specific location. These crimes may lack the necessary information to pinpoint the exact occurrence. Users can make requests to retrieve crimes with no location based on various parameters. The "category" parameter allows filtering based on the category of the crimes. Additionally, users can specify a specific police force using the "force" parameter. An optional "date" parameter can be used to limit the results to a specific month, with the latest month being shown by default. The API will respond with a list of crimes that match the specified criteria. The API response includes detailed information about each crime, including its category, unique persistent ID, location subtype, month of the crime, context (if applicable), and outcome status. The outcome status provides information about the latest recorded outcome for the crime, including the category and date. It's important to note that for this method, the location type and location subtype will always be null or an empty string, respectively. The "location" attribute will also be null since the crimes have no associated location information. The API response description includes a comprehensive list of outcome status codes and their corresponding names. These codes represent different outcomes or statuses related to the crime, such as awaiting court result, investigation complete with no suspect identified, or under investigation. Please keep in mind that the provided information is based on the latest available data and may vary over time.
The Police API Documentation for Stop and Searches by Area allows users to retrieve information about stop and searches conducted at street-level. These searches can be filtered based on a specific point within a 1-mile radius or a custom area. Please note that the stop and searches returned by the API, similar to crimes, are approximate locations and not exact coordinates of the actual incidents. For more details about the anonymization of locations, please refer to the about page provided. Users can make requests using specific parameters depending on their requirements. For stop and searches within a specific point, the latitude and longitude of the desired area should be provided. Optionally, users can limit the results to a specific month using the "date" parameter, with the latest month being shown by default. In the case of a custom area, the "poly" parameter is used to define the boundary of the desired area using lat/lng pairs. The coordinates are separated by colons and need not be the same for the first and last coordinates. The API will join them with a straight line once the request is made. However, it's important to keep in mind that GET requests longer than 4094 characters will receive a 400 status code. For complex poly parameters, consider using POST requests instead. The API response includes a list of stop and searches that match the specified criteria. Each entry in the response provides detailed information such as the age range of the person stopped, outcome of the search, involvement of a person, self-defined ethnicity, gender, legislation under which the search was conducted, outcome linked to the reason for the search, date and time of the incident, removal of more than outer clothing, location details (latitude, longitude, and street), operation details (if applicable), officer-defined ethnicity, type of search (person, vehicle, or both), operation name (if applicable), and the reason for the search. The response description also includes tags describing each field, such as type, involved_person, datetime, operation, operation_name, location (including latitude, longitude, street, id, and name), gender, age_range, self_defined_ethnicity, officer_defined_ethnicity, legislation, object_of_search, outcome, outcome_linked_to_object_of_search, and removal_of_more_than_outer_clothing. It's important to note that the response may include false or empty values for certain fields depending on the circumstances. For example, the outcome field may be false if nothing was found, or an empty string if no outcome was provided. Please be aware that the data provided is based on the latest available information and may vary over time. 
The Police API Documentation for Stop and Searches with No Location provides information about stop and searches that could not be mapped to a specific location. These searches are conducted by various police forces. Users can make requests using specific parameters to retrieve the desired data. The "force" parameter allows users to specify the police force that carried out the stop and searches. Additionally, the "date" parameter is optional and can be used to limit the results to a specific month, with the latest month being shown by default. The API response includes a list of stop and searches without location information that match the specified criteria. Each entry in the response provides detailed information such as the age range of the person stopped, self-defined ethnicity, outcome linked to the reason for the search, date and time of the incident, removal of more than outer clothing (if applicable), operation details (if applicable), officer-defined ethnicity, reason for the search, involvement of a person, gender, legislation under which the search was conducted, type of search (person, vehicle, or both), and operation name (if applicable). The response description also includes tags describing each field, such as type, involved_person, datetime, operation, operation_name, location (including latitude, longitude, street, id, and name), gender, age_range, self_defined_ethnicity, officer_defined_ethnicity, legislation, object_of_search, outcome, outcome_linked_to_object_of_search, and removal_of_more_than_outer_clothing. It's important to note that due to the absence of location data, the "location" field will be null in the response. The response may also include false or empty values for certain fields depending on the circumstances. For example, the outcome field may be false if nothing was found or an empty string if no outcome was provided. Please be aware that the data provided is based on the latest available information and may vary over time.
